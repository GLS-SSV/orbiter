\alertbox{If Orbiter does not show any scenarios in the Scenario tab, or if planets appear plain white without any textures when running the simulation, the most likely reason is that the installation packages were not properly unpacked. Make sure your Orbiter folder contains the subfolders as described above. If necessary, you may have to repeat the installation process.}
